  "story": [
    "In a small mountain village, every home kept a single candle burning at night. It was said the light kept away the spirits of loneliness that roamed in the dark.",
    "One winter, a great storm hit. One by one, the candles were blown out—except for the one in Mira’s cottage. She guarded it carefully, shielding it with her hands even as the wind howled through the cracks.",
    "When morning came, the villagers followed the faint glow through the snow and found warmth in her home. Her tiny flame had kept not just her safe, but the entire village’s hope alive.",
    "From that day on, they called her The Keeper of the Light."
